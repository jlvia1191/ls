\usage{
ls(formula, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An expression of the form y ~ model, where y is the outcome variable (binary or dichotomous: its values are 0 or 1).}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula), typically the environment from which lsm() is called.}
}
\value{
\code{ls} returns an object of class  \code{"ls"}.

An object of class  \code{"ls"} is a list containing at least the following components:

\item{log_Likelihood}{Estimation of the log likelihood.}
\item{populations}{Total number J of populations in the model.}
\item{z_j}{ Value of Zj (the sum of the observations in the jth population)}.
}
\description{
When the values of the outcome variable Y are either 0 or 1, the function lsm() calculates the estimation of the log likelihood in the saturated model. This model is characterized by Llinas (2006, ISSN:2389-8976) in section 2.3 through the assumptions 1 and 2. If Y is dichotomous and the data are grouped in J populations, it is recommended to use the function lsm() because it works very well for all K.

\details{
The saturated model is characterized by the assumptions 1 and 2 presented in section 2.3 by Llinas (2006, ISSN:2389-8976).
